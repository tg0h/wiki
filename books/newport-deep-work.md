## Rules

### 1. Work Deeply

> **4DX**
>
> 1. Focus on wildly important - deep work
> 2. Act on lead measures - deep work hours
> 3. Keep a compelling scoreboard - keep track of deep work hours
> 4. Regular review

Shutdown Ritual
Quickly skim every task and the calendar

### 2. Embrace Boredom

The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. Efforts to
deepen your focus will struggle if you don't wean your mind from a dependence on
distraction.

Schedule your internet use.

Structure your deep thinking - review the variables, next step question.

**Memorize a deck of cards.**

### 3. Avoid Social Media

### 4. Drain the Shallows

37signals gave its employees the entire month of June off to work deeply on
their own projects, free of any shallow work obligations. At the end of the
month, the company held a "pitch day"

**_Time blocking - schedule every minute of your day_**

Ask your boss for a shallow work budget
What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work?

:::danger important
Tell your boss - **"This is the exact percentage of my time spent on shallow work,"**
and force him to give exlicit approval for that ratio.
Faced with these numbers, and the economic reality they clarify (it's incredibley
wasteful, for example, to pay a highly trained professional to send e-mail messages
and attend meetings for thirty hours a week), a boss will be led to the natural
conclusion that you **need** to say no to some things and to streamline others -
even if this makes life less convenient for the boss, or for you, or for your
coworkers. Because, of course, in the end, a business's goal is to generate value,
not to make sure its employees' lives are as easy as possible.

Finish your work by six

**Commit to fixed-schedule productivity.**

> Set drastic quotas on the major sources of shallow work

:::tip
Be incredibly cautious about your use of the most dangerous word in your
productivity vocabulary: "yes."
:::

It should take a lot to convince you to agree to something that yields shallow
work.

Why am I wasting my life working on administrative minutiae.

Because my time is limited, I cannot afford to allow a large deadline to creep up
on me, or a morning to be wasted on something trivial, because I didn't take a
moment to craft a smart plan.

Fixed schedule productivity forces you to be ruthlessly asymmetric - reduce the
shallow, preserve the deep.

Reducing the shallow frees up more energy for deep work.

Limiting your time forces you to carefully think about your organizational habits.

Fixed schedule productivity shifts you into a scarcity mind-set. Suddenly any
obligation beyond your deepest efferts is suspect and seen as potentially disruptive.

> Your default answer becomes no

The bar for gaining access to your time and attention rises precipitously, and
you begin to organize the efforts that pass these obstacles with a ruthless
efficiency.

Become hard to reach
