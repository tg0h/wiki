(96) Do ask yourself these questions every six months:

Am I learning new skills and widening my areas of expertise?

Am I creating an impact in the organization?

Am I getting paid well enough for my skill set and experience?

If your answers are no to all of them, then you MUST think about switching companies or teams. If you have been in the present company for more than 2-3 years and your answers are yes to all of them then you should still think about switching companies or at least be open to it. You will never know what you are missing unless you are looking for it.
