## Responsibilities

### a. QA

I have been creating cli tools to make manual testing more painless. There is much drudgery in testing (or in life). For example, downloading the latest apk, installing it on the phone, uninstalling other apps on the phone, viewing the logcat output (on both android or ios), uploading an apk to app center, viewing a cloudwatch log, finding a cloudwatch log group to view 

Apart from removing the drudgery, I have also tried to set up UI testing for the Argus frontend

Experimentally, I have also tried creating a suite of cli scripts to exercise the argus backend. This has been useful in load testing. I created a thousand tasks with this suite and observed the behaviour of the frontend under load.

- March
  - Created iOS cli tool to print app debug output
- May
  - Created recurring job to generate certify patch and email to myself
- July
  - Created cloudwatch cli that accepts intuitive start and end time parameters for easier log filtering
    - use yargs library (cli framework)
- August
- September
  - Set up playwright test automation framework - 110h so far this year

### b. RM

I created racy to make release management easier. Racy displays the jira tickets in the sprint and also flags the ticket if it has an unexpected git status.

I am also interested in making visible ticket dependencies 

I have also made miscellaneous cli tools to edit tickets quickly, transition their status, show tickets in service desk

Why is racy important?
Release Management is slow. We are unsure of our dependencies. It is slow because documentation is done manually. We have to indicate the ticket's fix version and its component and then move the ticket along to done. Verification is also done manually to check if the ticket's code has been promoted to the correct git branch. The release notes are created manually.

<!-- Why is this important? -->

- March
  - Created cli for gitlab to download apk
- May
  - Created app center cli to manage release - download apk, publish release notes, publish app
- June
  - Set up Argus AU app in Google Play Store
- August
  - Created Jira cli tool
  - Refactored Argus CC Gitlab pipeline - 18h
  - Managed manual blue green deployment using Knox with users
- October
  - Created racy, a release management cli tool ~10-28 Oct - 70h
- November
  - service desk - (3h)
    - pagination - 1h
    - queues
      - get queues, queue issues - 2h
  - jira
    - transition tickets - accept stdin - 2h
    - project versions - (11h)
      - display, create, edit, delete - 7h
      - get issues - 4h
  - release notes
    - add cli for quick access and display
    - add cli to account for jira tickets in release against declared tickets in release notes e.g check if ticket is missing from release notes etc

### c. Monitoring

### d. On-Call & Incident Response

- August
  - Set up on-call workflow and rostering

### e. Support
